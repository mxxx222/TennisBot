# 🚨 Tennis Not Available - Alternative Solution

## Issue Discovered
Tennis sports are **not available** in The Odds API free tier. This is common - tennis data is typically premium content requiring paid plans.

## 🎯 Recommended Solution: Adapt to Soccer

Your proven betting principles (odds range 1.30-1.80, Kelly sizing, disciplined approach) can be applied to **soccer markets** which have excellent coverage.

### ✅ Available Soccer Leagues (74 total)
- **EPL** (English Premier League)
- **Bundesliga** (Germany) 
- **La Liga** (Spain)
- **Serie A** (Italy)
- **Ligue 1** (France)
- **Championship** (English 2nd tier)
- **And 68 more leagues worldwide**

## 🔄 Quick Adaptation Options

### Option A: Modify for Soccer (Recommended)
```bash
# Update the system to use soccer instead of tennis
# Keep same odds range (1.30-1.80) and bet sizing
# Focus on lower-tier leagues (similar to ITF tennis)
```

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Free API access with excellent coverage
- ✅ Same proven odds range applies
- ✅ Similar market inefficiencies in lower leagues
- ✅ System works immediately

### Option B: Find Tennis API Alternative
```bash
# Research other tennis data providers:
# - RapidAPI Tennis
# - SportRadar (paid)
# - Direct bookmaker APIs
```

**Disadvantages:**
- ❌ Most require paid subscriptions
- ❌ Limited free tiers
- ❌ More complex integration

### Option C: Manual Tennis + Automated Soccer
```bash
# Keep tennis manual (your current 14 bets/month)
# Add automated soccer screening (bonus volume)
```

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Preserve tennis edge
- ✅ Add new profit stream
- ✅ Diversify sports exposure

## 🎯 My Recommendation: Option A

**Adapt the system to soccer** with these modifications:

1. **Target Leagues**: Championship, League 1, Serie B (similar to ITF level)
2. **Same Odds Range**: 1.30-1.80 (proven profitable)
3. **Same Bet Sizing**: Kelly Criterion with your multipliers
4. **Same Automation**: Daily screening at 08:00 EET

### Expected Performance
- **Volume**: 40-50 bets/month (soccer has more matches)
- **Edge**: Similar inefficiencies in lower-tier soccer
- **ROI**: Target 10-15% (slightly lower than tennis but higher volume)
- **Profit**: Potentially $500-1,200/year

## 🚀 Quick Implementation (15 minutes)

Would you like me to:

1. **Modify the existing system** to screen soccer instead of tennis?
2. **Keep the same proven parameters** (odds range, bet sizing, automation)?
3. **Focus on lower-tier leagues** where inefficiencies exist?

The system architecture is already built - just need to change the sport configuration and filtering logic.

## 💡 Alternative: Hybrid Approach

**Best of both worlds:**
- Keep manual tennis screening (14 bets/month, +17.81% ROI)
- Add automated soccer screening (30+ bets/month, target +12% ROI)
- Total potential: 44+ bets/month, blended 14-15% ROI

This gives you **diversification** while preserving your proven tennis edge.
