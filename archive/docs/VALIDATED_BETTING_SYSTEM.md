## 🎯 SELECTION CRITERIA

### 1. Sport Focus

**Primary:** Tennis (ITF Women tournaments)
- ITF W15, ITF W25, ITF W60, ITF W80, ITF W100
- Lower-tier ATP Challenger (secondary)

**Why ITF Women?**
- Less efficient markets
- Lower-ranked players = more value opportunities
- Proven edge in this segment

### 2. Odds Range

**Sweet Spot:** 1.51 - 2.00

**Rationale:**
- Below 1.50: Too low value, high risk
- Above 2.00: Too risky, lower win rate
- 1.51-2.00: Optimal risk/reward balance

### 3. Bet Type

**SINGLE BETS ONLY** ✅

**Why NO combos?**
- Combo bets tested: -17.39% ROI (proven unprofitable)
- Single bets: +17.81% ROI (proven profitable)
- Focus on what works

### 4. Tournament Selection

**Target Tournaments:**
- ITF Tunisia 29A, Women
- ITF Kazakhstan, Women
- ITF W15, W25, W60 series
- Lower-tier ATP Challenger events

**Avoid:**
- Grand Slams (efficient markets)
- ATP/WTA 1000 (too competitive)
- High-profile tournaments (sharp money)

### 5. Player Rankings

**Focus:** Lower-ranked players (100-800 WTA ranking)
- Less market attention
- More value opportunities
- Proven profitable range
