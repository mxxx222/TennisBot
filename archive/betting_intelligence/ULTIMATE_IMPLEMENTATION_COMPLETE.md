    implied_probability = 1 / bookmaker_odds
    value_edge = (model_probability * bookmaker_odds) - 1
    
    if value_edge > MIN_VALUE_THRESHOLD:
        opportunity.confidence = assess_data_quality(multiple_sources)
        opportunity.risk_level = calculate_risk_factors()
        
        if opportunity.confidence > MIN_CONFIDENCE:
            yield_high_value_signal(opportunity)
```
